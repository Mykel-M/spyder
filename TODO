Handle strange errors:

1. On server switch, my server messages are not being cleared IF the cache/db has
messages for the server I am switcing to and FROM

2. Websocket sometimes randomly broadcasts messages multiple times and on multiple
servers, likely due to not unsubscribing (multiple server subs).
